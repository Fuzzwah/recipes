* 55g (1/3 cup) pine nuts
* 1 tablespoon olive oil

## METHOD
### Step 1
Cook the pasta in a large saucepan of salted boiling water following packet directions, or until al dente. Drain and return to the pan.

Meanwhile, heat a medium non-stick frying pan over medium heat. Add the pine nuts and cook, stirring, for 1 minute or until golden and toasted. Transfer the pine nuts to a plate. Heat the oil in the frying pan. Add the onion and garlic, and cook, stirring occasionally, for 2 minutes or until the onion softens slightly.
### Step 3
Add the artichoke pieces, olives, sun-dried tomatoes and capers to the pan. Toss over medium heat for 2 minutes or until warmed through.
### Step 4
Add the artichoke mixture, feta and basil to the pasta. Toss gently to combine. Taste and season with salt and pepper. Serve immediately.
