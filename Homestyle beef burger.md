#### 0:50 Prep -- 0:40 Cook -- 4 Servings
## INGREDIENTS
* 600g beef mince
* 1/2 teaspoon dried chilli flakes
* 1 onion, finely chopped
* 1 teaspoon dried oregano
* 1 teaspoon Dijon mustard
* 1 egg, beaten
* 1/2 cup (35g) fresh breadcrumbs
* 1/3 cup (25g) grated parmesan
* 2 red capsicums, quartered
* 2 tablespoons sunflower oil
* 4 burger buns, split, toasted
* Butter lettuce leaves, to serve
* Tomato, sliced, to serve
* Gherkins, to serve
* Aioli, to serve
## METHOD
### Step 1
Combine mince, chilli, onion, oregano, Dijon, egg, crumbs and parmesan in a bowl. Season, mix with damp hands, then form into 4 patties. Chill for 30 minutes.
### Step 2
Meanwhile, preheat grill to high. Grill capsicum, skin-side up, for 3-4 minutes until the skin blisters and blackens. Place capsicum in a plastic bag and stand for 15 minutes. Once cool enough to handle, remove and discard skin. Slice into strips.
### Step 3
Place a frypan over medium-high heat. Brush burger patties with oil, then cook for 5 minutes each side until cooked through.
### Step 4
Fill buns with lettuce, patties, grilled capsicum, tomato, gherkins and aioli.
