## INGREDIENTS
* 2/3 cup plain flour
* 1/2 cup self-raising flour
* 1 teaspoon ground cumin
* 1/2 teaspoon smoked paprika
* 2 eggs, lightly beaten
* 2/3 cup milk
* 400g can red kidney beans, drained, rinsed
* 125g can corn kernels, drained
* 1 small zucchini, grated
* 1/2 cup grated reduced fat cheddar
* 1 tablespoon finely chopped fresh coriander leaves, plus extra sprigs to serve
* Vegetable oil, for shallow-frying
* 1/4 cup light sour cream
* Salad leaves, to serve
### AVOCADO CHILLI SALSA
* 1 large avocado, roughly chopped
* 1 long red chilli, finely chopped
* 1 tablespoon lime juice
* 2 tablespoons finely chopped fresh coriander leaves
## METHOD
### Step 1
Sift flours into a bowl. Stir in cumin and paprika. Make a well.
### Step 2
Whisk egg and milk together in a jug. Gradually whisk into flour mixture to form a thick batter. Mash 1/2 of the kidney beans in a bowl. Add to batter with corn, zucchini, cheddar, chopped coriander and remaining beans. Season with salt and pepper. Set aside for 10 minutes.
### Step 3
Pour enough oil into a large frying pan to come 5mm up side of pan. Heat over medium-high heat. Add 1/4 cup batter to pan. Repeat 3 more times to make 4 fritters. Cook for 3 minutes each side or until browned and cooked through. Drain on paper towel. Cover to keep warm. Repeat with remaining batter to make 12 fritters.
### Step 4
Meanwhile, make avocado chilli salsa. Place avocado, chilli, lime juice and coriander in a bowl. Toss gently to combine. Season with salt and pepper. Serve fritters with salsa, sour cream, salad leaves and coriander sprigs.
