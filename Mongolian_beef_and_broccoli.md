#### 0:15 Prep -- 0:20 Cook -- 6 Servings
## INGREDIENTS
### Marinade:
* 1 kg beef tenderloin , thinly sliced
* 2 tablespoons water
* 1 tablespoon soy sauce
* 1 tablespoon rice wine vinegar
* 2 tablespoons corn flour
### Sauce:
* 1/2 cup soy sauce
* 2/3 cup water
* 1/3 cup brown sugar 
* 2 tablespoons hoisin sauce
* 1 tablespoon oyster sauce
* 2 teaspoons red chili powder
### Stir Fry:
* 1/4 cup oil
* 1 teaspoon sesame oil
* 8 cloves (or 4 tablespoons) garlic, minced
* 1/2 tablespoon minced ginger
* 1 Broccoli , cut into florets
* 4 green onion / scallion stems , thinly sliced
* 1 tablespoon corn flour mixed with 2 tablespoons water
## METHOD
### Step 1
Whisk marinade ingredients together until well combined. Marinate the beef slices for 30 minutes to an hour (The more marinading, the more tender the meat will be).
### Step 2
While beef is marinating, whisk together the sauce ingredients until well combined. Set aside and prepare vegetables.
### Step 3
Heat up a wok over medium heat with the 1/4 cup of oil. When oil is hot, stir-fry the marinated beef in batches of four (don't crowd the wok) until they are just crisp on the edges (about 2 minutes. They cook FAST in the hot oil. Don't have the oil on high heat or it will spit and spatter all over you and your stove). Remove the meat, leaving as much oil in the wok, and set aside.
### Step 4
Heat up the sesame oil in the wok with any remaining oil, and stir-fry the garlic and ginger until fragrant. Add the vegetables and stir fry until they are vibrant in colour and just tender.
### Step 5
Add the beef back into the wok with the prepared sauce. Simmer in the sauce until the beef slices are cooked through (about 2 minutes); add the con starch mixture and the sliced green onions. Cook for a further minute or until the sauce thickens, wile stirring quickly.
### Step 6
Garnish with extra green onion slices and serve immediately over rice or steamed vegetables.
