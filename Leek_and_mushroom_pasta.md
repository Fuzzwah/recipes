## INGREDIENTS
* 250g farfalle pasta
* 1 bunch asparagus, ends trimmed, cut into 2cm pieces
* 1 tbs olive oil
* 2 leeks, pale section only, thickly sliced
* 1 garlic clove, crushed
* 200g brown cup mushrooms, sliced
* 3/4 cup (185ml) light thickened cream
* 100g blue cheese, crumbled
* 1/2 cup (50g) walnuts, toasted, coarsely chopped
* 60g baby rocket
## METHOD
### Step 1
Cook the pasta in a large saucepan of boiling water following packet directions or until al dente, adding the asparagus for the last 1 min of cooking. Drain well, reserving Â½ cup (125ml) of the cooking liquid.
### Step 2
Meanwhile, heat half the oil in a large frying pan over medium heat. Add the leek and garlic and cook, stirring, for 3 mins or until leek just softens. Transfer to a bowl.
### Step 3
Add the remaining oil to the pan. Increase heat to medium-high. Add the mushroom and cook, stirring, for 5 mins or until tender. Return leek to the pan. Add the cream, half the blue cheese and the reserved cooking water. Cook for 1-2 mins or until mixture comes to a simmer. Add the pasta, walnut and rocket. Toss to combine.
### Step 4
Divide the pasta mixture among serving bowls. Season. Sprinkle with remaining blue cheese.
