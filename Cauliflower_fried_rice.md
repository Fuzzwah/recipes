#### 0:15 Prep -- 0:05 Cook -- 4 Servings
## INGREDIENTS
* 1/2 medium cauliflower, cored, coarsely chopped (about 480g)
* 2 extra-large eggs
* 2 tbsp canola oil, divided
* 1 tbsp sesame oil
* 100g snow peas, trimmed, thinly sliced lengthways
* 1 carrot, peeled, thinly sliced
* 5 spring onions, thinly sliced, white and pale green parts separated from dark green parts
* 1 tbsp finely grated ginger
* 2 garlic cloves, crushed
* 2 tbsp salt-reduced soy sauce
* 1/2 cup (75g) unsalted roasted cashews, coarsely chopped
## METHOD
### Step 1
Chop the cauliflower finely, but don't worry too much if there's some larger pieces. Transfer to a bowl. Repeat with the remaining cauliflower (you’ll need 4 cups of cauliflower rice).
### Step 2
Using a fork, whisk eggs in a bowl. Heat a large non-stick frying pan or wok over high heat. Add 1 tbs canola oil and egg. Cook for 30 secs or until almost set. Continue cooking, turning the egg and breaking into pieces, until cooked through. Transfer to a plate. Chop.
### Step 3
Add sesame oil and remaining canola oil to the pan or wok. Add the snow peas, carrot, white and pale green parts of the spring onions, ginger and garlic. Stir-fry for 1½ mins. Stir in the cauliflower rice and soy sauce. Cook, stirring often, for 2 mins or until cauliflower is heated through.
### Step 4
Remove the pan or wok from heat and fold in the egg, dark green parts of the spring onions and cashews.
