## INGREDIENTS
* 1 tablespoon finely chopped fresh rosemary
* 1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil
* 1/3 cup balsamic vinegar
* 3 garlic cloves, crushed
* 450g beef rump steak, trimmed, cut into 2cm pieces
* 250g cup mushrooms, halved
* 1 bunch baby beetroot, trimmed
* 1 cup buckwheat, rinsed
* 1 cup Massel salt reduced chicken style liquid stock
* 1/2 cup orange juice
* 1 cup fresh flat-leaf parsley leaves
* 1/2 small red onion, thinly sliced
* 2 tablespoons roughly chopped dry roasted hazelnuts
* 50g reduced-fat fetta, crumbled
## METHOD
### Step 1
Preheat oven to 200C/180C fan-forced. Combine rosemary, 2 tablespoons oil, 2 tablespoons vinegar and 2/3 garlic in a large glass or ceramic bowl. Stir in beef and mushroom. Refrigerate for 1 hour.
### Step 2
Meanwhile, wash beetroot and pat dry. Wrap each in foil. Place on a baking tray. Roast for 40 minutes or until tender. Set aside until cool enough to handle. Wearing disposable gloves, peel beetroot. Cut into wedges. Place beetroot in a bowl. Add 1 tablespoon remaining vinegar and remaining garlic. Season. Toss to coat.
### Step 3
Meanwhile, heat a large saucepan over medium-high heat. Add buckwheat. Cook, stirring, for 1 minute. Add stock and juice. Stir to combine. Bring to the boil. Reduce heat to medium. Simmer, covered, for 15 to 20 minutes or until buckwheat is tender and liquid has been absorbed. Remove from heat. Stand for 5 minutes. Fluff mixture with a fork. Transfer to a large bowl.
### Step 4
Thread beef and mushroom onto skewers. Heat a barbecue grill on medium-high heat. Cook for 2 minutes each side for medium or until cooked to your liking.
### Step 5
Add parsley, onion, hazelnuts and fetta to buckwheat. Season. Toss to combine. Arrange buckwheat salad, beetroot and skewers on a serving platter. Whisk remaining oil and vinegar in a small bowl. Drizzle over buckwheat mixture. Serve.
