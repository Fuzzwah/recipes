Add the potato to the pan and cook turning occasionally, for 5 minutes or until golden brown. Transfer to the bowl. Add the onion, capsicum and garlic to the pan and cook for 2-3 minutes or until onion softens. Return the chicken and potatoes to the pan. Add the wine and bring to the boil. Reduce heat to low. Add the Heinz Big Red tomato soup, chicken stock and olives and bring to a simmer. Remove from heat. Sprinkle with oregano.
