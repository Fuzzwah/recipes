#### 0:15 Prep -- 0:10 Cook -- 4 Servings
## INGREDIENTS
* 300g fresh fettuccine
* 1 lemon
* 1/2 cup (80g) fresh peas or frozen peas
* 1/2 cup (85g) frozen broad beans, peeled
* 100g snow peas, thinly sliced lengthways
* 1 bunch asparagus, woody ends trimmed
* 4 yellow squash, end trimmed, thinly sliced
* 2 teaspoons olive oil
* 2 garlic cloves, crushed
* 1 tablespoon Dijon mustard
* 250ml PHILADELPHIA Light Cream For Cooking, a cream alternative
* 4 green shallots, thinly sliced
## METHOD
### Step 1
Use a zester to remove the rind from the lemon. (Alternatively, use a vegetable peeler to peel rind from lemon. Use a small, sharp knife to remove white pith from rind. Cut rind into very thin strips). Juice the lemon.
### Step 2
Cook the pasta following packet directions until al dente. Add the peas, broad beans, snow peas, asparagus and squash in the last 2 minutes of cooking or until bright green and tender crisp. Drain well.
### Step 3
Meanwhile, heat the oil in a large frying pan over medium heat. Add the garlic and cook, stirring occasionally, for 30 seconds or until aromatic. Add the mustard, lemon juice and PHILLY and bring to a simmer. Cook for 1-2 minutes or until sauce thickens slightly. Add the pasta mixture and half the shallots and half the lemon rind and toss to combine. Remove from heat. Taste and season with salt and pepper.
### Step 4
Divide among serving bowls. Top with remaining shallots and lemon rind and serve immediately.
