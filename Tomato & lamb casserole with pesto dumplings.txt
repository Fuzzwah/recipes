INGREDIENTS
40g (1/4 cup) plain flour
1.5kg mini lamb round roasts, cut into 3cm pieces
3 tablespoons olive oil
8 slices Primo Gourmet Selection Prosciutto, coarsely chopped
1 large brown onion, halved, thinly sliced
1 x 800g can diced tomatoes
250ml (1 cup) chicken stock
4 dried bay leaves
1 x 500g pkt frozen broad beans, thawed, peeled
PESTO DUMPLINGS
190g (1 1/4 cups) self-raising flour
70g chilled butter, chopped
60ml (1/4 cup) milk
1 tablespoon bought basil pesto
METHOD
Step 1
Preheat oven to 180°C. Place flour on a plate. Season with salt and pepper. Add lamb and toss to coat. Shake off excess.
Step 2
Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a 4L (16-cup) capacity flameproof, ovenproof casserole dish over medium heat. Add half the lamb and cook for 2-3 minutes each side or until brown. Transfer to a plate. Repeat with 1 tablespoon of oil and remaining lamb, reheating dish between batches.
Step 3
Heat the remaining oil in dish. Add the prosciutto and onion and cook, stirring, for 2-3 minutes or until onion is soft.
Step 4
Return the lamb to the dish. Add the tomato, stock and bay leaves. Cover and bake in oven for 1 1/2 hours or until the lamb is tender.
Step 5
Meanwhile, to make pesto dumplings, place flour in a bowl. Use your fingertips to rub the butter into the flour until it resembles fine breadcrumbs. Pour in milk. Use a round-bladed knife in a cutting motion to mix until evenly incorporated. Add pesto and mix to create a swirled effect. Divide dough into 12 equal portions. Roll each portion into a ball.
Step 6
Increase oven temperature to 220°C. Add the broad beans to the lamb mixture and combine. Top with the dumplings. Bake, uncovered, for 10-15 minutes or until the dumplings are golden. Serve.
NOTES
Freezing tip: Cool at the end of step 4. Freeze in an airtight container for up to three months. Thaw in fridge overnight. Reheat. Continue from step 5.
