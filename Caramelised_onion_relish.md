#### 0:15 Prep -- 0:50 Cook -- Makes 2 cups
## INGREDIENTS
* 2 tablespoons olive oil
* 1kg brown onions, cut into thin wedges
* 1 teaspoon mustard powder
* 1/2 cup brown sugar
* 1/4 cup red wine vinegar
* 1/2 cup dry apera (sherry)
## EQUIPMENT
You'll need a 2 cup-capacity glass jar with lid.
## METHOD
### Step 1
Heat oil in a large, deep frying pan over low heat. Add onion. Cook, stirring occasionally, for 25 to 30 minutes or until softened. Add mustard, sugar, vinegar and apera. Increase heat to medium-low. Cook, stirring occasionally, for 20 minutes or until liquid has evaporated and relish has thickened slightly. Season with salt and pepper.
### Step 2
Spoon relish into a hot sterilised jar and seal (see note). Store in the fridge for up to 3 months. Once opened, refrigerate and consume within 2 weeks.
### NOTES
Cook's note: To sterilise jar, preheat oven to 100C/80C fan-forced. Wash jar and lid in hot soapy water. Place in a large saucepan. Cover with water. Bring to the boil over high heat. Boil for 10 minutes. Remove from heat. Using tongs, carefully transfer jars and lids to a tea towel-lined baking tray. Place in oven until required.

For a richer relish, use dark brown sugar and replace the red wine vinegar with balsamic.
