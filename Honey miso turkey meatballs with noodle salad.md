## INGREDIENTS
* 3 green shallots
* 600g turkey mince
* 1 tablespoon finely grated fresh ginger
* 2 garlic cloves, crushed
* 2 1/2 tablespoons miso paste
* 12.5g (1/4 cup) panko breadcrumbs
* 60ml (1/4 cup) mirin
* 60ml (1/4 cup) rice wine vinegar
* 2 1/2 tablespoons honey
* 180g soba noodles
* 2 bunches broccolini, halved diagonally
* 2 cups edamame beans, blanched, podded
* 3 teaspoons sesame oil
* Shiso leaves or Asian greens, to serve (optional)
## METHOD
### Step 1
Thinly slice 2 shallots diagonally and reserve. Finely chop remaining shallot. Place in a bowl. Add turkey mince, 2 teaspoons ginger, garlic, 3 teaspoons miso and breadcrumbs. Season and combine. Roll tablespoonfuls of the mixture into balls. Place on a lined tray.
### Step 2
Whisk together the mirin, vinegar, honey and remaining ginger and miso in a jug. Cook the noodles and broccolini in a large saucepan of boiling water for 3-4 minutes or until just tender. Drain and refresh. Transfer to a bowl. Add edamame, sliced shallot and 1 teaspoon sesame oil. Toss to combine.
### Step 3
Heat the remaining oil in a large non-stick frying pan over mediumhigh heat. Cook meatballs, turning, for 6 minutes or until golden. Add the miso mixture. Cook, stirring occasionally, for 3-4 minutes until the liquid is syrupy and the meatballs are cooked through.
### Step 4
Divide the noodle salad among bowls. Top with the meatballs and drizzle with the sauce. Serve with shiso leaves or Asian greens if using.
## NOTES
Prepare meatballs up to 1 day in advance. Place on a lined tray, cover with plastic wrap and store in the fridge until needed.
