## INGREDIENTS
* 450g fresh hokkien noodles
* 2 teaspoons sesame oil
* 200g fresh shiitake mushrooms, halved
* 3 garlic cloves, crushed
* 3 tsp Kewpie Roasted Sesame Dressing, plus extra, to serve
* 460g beef stir-fry strips
* 3 teaspoons ginger paste
* 1/2 teaspoon Chinese five spice
* 1 tablespoon Shaoxing wine
* 35g (1/4 cup) cornflour
* 60ml (1/4 cup) peanut oil
* 200g bunch broccolini, halved lengthways
* 100g baby spinach
* 60ml (1/4 cup) oyster sauce

## METHOD
### Step 1
Place the noodles in a large heatproof bowl. Cover with boiling water. Set aside for 5 minutes to soften. Drain well.
### Step 2
Meanwhile, heat the sesame oil in a large wok or non-stick frying pan over medium-high heat. Add mushroom and cook, stirring, for 2-3 minutes or until softened. Add half the garlic and stir for 1-2 minutes or until golden. Stir in sesame dressing. Transfer to a bowl and set aside.
### Step 3
Combine the beef, ginger paste, five spice, Shaoxing wine and remaining garlic in a bowl. Mix well, then transfer the beef to a large sealable plastic bag. Add the cornflour, seal and shake to coat.
### Step 4
Heat about 1 tbs peanut oil in wok or pan over high heat. Add a third of the beef. Cook for 2-3 minutes or until crisp. Transfer to a plate. Repeat with remaining oil and beef.
### Step 5
Add the broccolini to the wok or pan. Cook over medium-high heat, stirring, for 2 minutes or until tender-crisp. Add the noodles and cook, stirring, for 2 minutes. Add the spinach and cook for 1 minute, until wilted. Return the mushroom and beef to the wok or pan, add the oyster sauce and toss to coat.
### Step 6
Divide the noodle mixture among serving bowls. Drizzle with the extra dressing and sprinkle with sesame seeds and chilli.
