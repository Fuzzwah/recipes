#### 0:10 Prep -- 0:10 Cook -- 4 Servings
## INGREDIENTS
* 450g Ground beef
* 28g Panko (~ 1/3 cup)
* 90g Onion (~1/3 cup, finely minced)
* 2 tsp	Oyster sauce
* 2 tsp Worcestershire sauce
* 1/2 tsp Black pepper
* 4 tsp Vegetable oil
* 100g Button mushrooms (5 small mushrooms)
* 4 tbs Cultured unsalted butter
* 4 tbs All-purpose flour
* 2 cups Beef stock
* 1 tbs Soy sauce
* 2 tsp Bourbon
* 4 large Eggs
## METHOD
### Step 1
Add the ground beef, panko, onions, oyster sauce, worcestershire sauce and black pepper to a bowl and mix until well combined, but don't be too aggressive with your mixing or it will make the patties too dense. Chopsticks work really well for mixing.
### Step 2
Split the mixture into 4 pieces and form them into 4 patties that are about a 3/4-inch (2cm) thick.
### Step 3
Heat a sauté pan over medium heat until hot, and then add the oil. Add the patties and fry until they have a brown crust on one side (about 2 1/2 minutes). Flip the patties and fry until they're cooked through (another 2 1/2 minutes).
### Step 4
Transfer the patties to a plate and then add the mushrooms, sauteéing until the mushrooms are well browned.
### Step 5
While the mushrooms are frying heat another sauté pan, add a bit of oil and fry the eggs however you like them.
### Step 6
Push the mushrooms to the sides of the pan and melt the butter in the center along with the flour. Fry the roux until a medium brown.
### Step 7
Remove the pan from the heat and whisk in the beef stock, soy sauce and bourbon.
### Step 8
Once the mixture is smooth and free of lumps, put it back on the stove and bring to a boil, cooking until the gravy is nice and thick.
### Step 9
To plate the Loco Moco, first put down a mound of hot rice. Top with the beef patties and then sprinkle on a handful of fried shallots. Cover everything with the mushroom gravy and then top with a fried egg.
