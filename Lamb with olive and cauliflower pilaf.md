## INGREDIENTS
* 2 (about 620g) lamb backstraps
* 2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
* 2 teaspoons ground cumin
* 2 teaspoons ground coriander
* 1 small head cauliflower, cut into florets
* 120g marinated green olives with chilli & garlic, halved

## METHOD
### Step 1
Place lamb on a plate. Add 2 teaspoons oil, 1 teaspoon cumin and 1 teaspoon coriander. Season. Turn to coat. Set aside to marinate.
### Step 2
Meanwhile, process cauliflower in a food processor until finely chopped. Heat remaining oil in a large frying pan over medium-high heat. Add olives and currants. Cook, stirring, for 1 minute. Add lemon rind and remaining cumin and coriander. Cook, stirring, for 1 minute. Add the cauliflower. Cook, stirring, for 2 minutes. Season well. Add half the lemon juice. Cook, covered, stirring occasionally, for 3-4 minutes or until just tender. Set aside to cool slightly.
### Step 3
Heat a non-stick frying pan over medium heat. Cook lamb, turning, for 6 minutes for medium or until cooked to your liking. Remove pan from heat. Drizzle with honey and remaining lemon juice. Set aside for 3 minutes to rest. Slice lamb.
### Step 4
Stir the shallot and herbs into cauliflower mixture. Divide among plates. Top with lamb and yoghurt, if using, and drizzle with pan juices. Sprinkle with pine nuts.
