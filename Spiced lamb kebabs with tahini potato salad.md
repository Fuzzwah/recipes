#### 0:10 Prep -- 0:20 Cook -- 4 Servings
## INGREDIENTS
* 750g baby red-skinned potatoes, halved
* 600g lamb fillet, cut into 3cm pieces
* 1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil
* 1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice
* 1 garlic cloves, crushed
* 1 1/2 teaspoons ground coriander
* 1 1/2 teaspoons ground cumin
* 235g (1 1/2 cups) frozen broad beans, thawed, podded
* Sorrel leaves, to serve (optional)
### TAHINI SAUCE
* 75g (1/4 cup) hulled tahini
* 1 cup fresh herbs (fresh continental parsley and mint leaves)
* 1 small lemon, rind finely grated, juiced
* 2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
* 2 tablespoons water
* 1 garlic clove, chopped
* 1/2 teaspoon ground coriander
* 1/2 teaspoon ground cumin
## EQUIPMENT
8 small barbecue skewers
## METHOD
### Step 1
Place the potatoes in a saucepan. Cover with cold water. Bring to the boil over high heat. Simmer for 10-12 minutes or until just tender. Drain. Refresh under cold running water.
### Step 2
Combine lamb, oil, lemon, garlic, coriander and cumin in a bowl. Season. Thread onto 8 small pre-soaked bamboo skewers.
### Step 3
For the tahini sauce, place all the ingredients in a blender and blend until smooth. Season.
### Step 4
Preheat a chargrill pan or barbecue grill on medium-high. Cook the lamb skewers, turning, for 4-5 minutes for medium or until cooked to your liking. Transfer to a plate. Set aside for 3 minutes to rest.
### Step 5
Combine potatoes, broad beans and three-quarters of the sauce in a bowl. Divide among plates. Top with lamb. Drizzle with remaining sauce. Serve with sorrel leaves, if using.
## NOTES
Tip: try processing any leftover broad beans with fresh ricotta, lemon rind, lemon juice and fresh mint leaves for a tasty and healthy dip or sandwich spread.
