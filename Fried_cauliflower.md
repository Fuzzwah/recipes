#### 0:30 Prep -- 0:30 Cook -- 4 Servings
## INGREDIENTS
* 150g (1 cup) plain flour
* 35g (1/4 cup) cornflour
* 1 teaspoon baking powder
* 310ml (1 1/4 cups) chilled soda water
* 350g trimmed cauliflower, cut into very small florets
* Peanut oil, to deep-fry
* Steamed rice, to serve
* Sesame seeds, to sprinkle
* Green shallots, trimmed, sliced, to serve
## Sauce
* 1 tablespoon peanut oil
* 3 garlic cloves, crushed
* 160ml (2/3 cup) tomato passata
* 80ml (1/3 cup) hot chilli sauce (like Sriracha)
* 80ml (1/3 cup) water
* 2 tablespoons brown sugar
* 2 tablespoons light soy sauce
* 3 teaspoons rice vinegar
* 1 teaspoon sesame oil
## METHOD
### Step 1
To make the sauce, heat the oil in a wok over high heat. Stir-fry the garlic for 30 seconds or until aromatic. Add the passata, chilli sauce, 80ml (1/3 cup) water, sugar, soy sauce and vinegar. Simmer, stirring occasionally, for 15 minutes or until thickened. Stir through the sesame oil. Set aside.
### Step 2
Whisk together the flour, cornflour and baking powder in a large bowl. Make a well in the centre. Slowly pour in the soda water, whisking to form a smooth batter. Toss the cauliflower through to coat.
### Step 3
Heat 2cm oil in a large saucepan over high heat to 160C. Cook the cauliflower, in batches, for 3 minutes or until golden. Use a slotted spoon to transfer to a wire rack set over a baking tray to drain.
### Step 4
Return the wok with the sauce to medium heat. Toss through the cauliflower. Serve on a bed of rice, sprinkled with sesame seeds and shallot.
