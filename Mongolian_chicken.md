## INGREDIENTS
* 2 teaspoons cornflour
* 1/2 teaspoon Chinese five-spice powder
* 1/4 cup shao hsing (Chinese rice wine)
* 2 garlic cloves, crushed
* 2cm piece fresh ginger, grated
* 2 tablespoons soy sauce
* 500g chicken breast stir-fry strips
* 1 tablespoon peanut oil
* 1 brown onion, cut into thick wedges
* 3 green onions, cut into 4cm lengths
* 1/3 cup hoisin sauce
* 2 teaspoons sesame oil
* 1  teaspoon sesame seeds, toasted
* 4 cups steamed white long-grain rice
* 300g snow peas, trimmed, steamed
## METHOD
### Step 1
Blend cornflour, five-spice, shao hsing, garlic, ginger and 2 teaspoons soy sauce in a bowl. Add chicken. Toss to coat. Refrigerate for 30 minutes to allow flavours to develop.
### Step 2
Heat 1/2 the peanut oil in a wok or large frying pan over high heat. Drain chicken from marinade, reserving marinade. Stir-fry chicken, in 2 batches, for 2 minutes or until lightly browned and just cooked through. Transfer to a heatproof bowl. Wipe wok clean.
### Step 3
Heat remaining peanut oil in wok over high heat. Add onions. Stir-fry for 1 minute or until starting to char. Return chicken to wok with reserved marinade, hoisin sauce, sesame oil and remaining soy sauce. Stir-fry for 2 to 3 minutes or until sauce boils and thickens, and chicken is heated through.
### Step 4
Sprinkle stir-fry with sesame seeds. Serve with rice and snow peas.
