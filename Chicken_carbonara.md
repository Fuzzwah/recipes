Crack the eggs in a small bowl and add grated cheese. Whisk until blended, then set aside.
### Step 4
Chop cooked chicken and ham/bacon into smaller pieces.
### Step 5
Drain pasta, save some of the water. Toss pasta into large saucepan, add chicken and ham/bacon and stir. On low heat, pour egg and cheese mixture over the pasta/chicken/ham and stir constantly. Ensure the egg and cheese mixture coats the pasta/chicken/ham and doesn't simply become scrambled eggs.
