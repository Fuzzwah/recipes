#### 0:15 Prep -- 0:35 Cook -- 6 Servings
## INGREDIENTS
* 8 cups chopped cauliflower florets, 1/2-inch pieces
* 1 tbsp butter
* 2 teaspoons olive oil
* 1/4 cup minced onion
* 3 tbsp flour
* 2 cups milk
* 2 cups freshly grated sharp cheddar
* 1/2 teaspoons salt
## METHOD
### Step 1
Preheat the oven to 4200ÂºC.
### Step 1
Place 1 inch of water in a large pot with 1 teaspoon salt and bring to a boil. Add the cauliflower and cook until tender crisp, 6 to 7 minutes. Drain and set aside in a large bowl.
### Step 2
Heat butter and oil in a large saucepan over medium heat. Add onions and cook about 2 minutes.
### Step 3
Stir in flour. Reduce heat to low and cook, stirring continually 3 - 4 minutes, to cook out the flour.
### Step 4
Add the milk and continue whisking, raising heat to medium-high until it comes to a boil and becomes smooth and thick, about 2 minutes stirring; season with 1/2 teaspoon salt and black pepper.
### Step 5
Once it becomes thick, remove from heat completely onto another burner if possible. Add the cheddar cheese, 1/4 cup at a time mixing well until cheese is all melted.
### Step 6
Stir in cooked cauliflower, then pour into a baking dish and bake until bubbly and golden, about 15 to 20 minutes. Then broil 2 minutes, or until the top is slightly browned.
