#### 0:20 Prep -- 0:20 Cook -- 4 Servings
## INGREDIENTS
* 400g pkt brussels sprouts, finely shredded
* 2 zucchini, coarsely grated
* 225g haloumi, coarsely grated
* 2 eggs, lightly whisked
* 1/2 cup (75g) self-raising flour
* 1/3 cup (80 ml) milk
* 2 tablespoons dill, finely chopped
* 2 tablespoons olive oil
* 1/2 cup (140g) Greek-style yoghurt
* 200g Perino tomatoes, halved
* Mint leaves, to serve
## METHOD
### Step 1
Heat a large frying pan over medium-high heat. Add the brussels sprout and cook, stirring, for 5 mins or until tender. Transfer to a bowl and set aside for 5 mins to cool slightly. Add the zucchini, haloumi and egg and stir to combine. Add the flour, milk and half the dill and stir to combine. Season.
### Step 2
Heat the oil in a large frying pan over medium heat. Pour three 1/4-cup (60ml) portions of mixture into the pan, allowing room for spreading. Cook for 2 mins or until golden underneath. Turn and cook for a further 1 min or until golden and cooked through. Transfer to a plate. Repeat, in 3 more batches, with remaining batter.
### Step 3
Combine yoghurt and remaining dill in a bowl. Combine the tomato and mint leaves in a large bowl. Divide the fritters among serving plates. Serve with tomato salad and yoghurt mixture.
