* 1 red capsicum, seeded, thinly sliced
* 80g (1/2 cup) roasted unsalted peanuts
* 2 garlic cloves, crushed
* 2 teaspoons crushed chilli
* 2 teaspoons finely grated fresh ginger
* 185ml (3/4 cup) chicken stock

## METHOD
### Step 1
Heat a wok or frying pan over high heat. Add half the oil and heat until just smoking. Stir-fry one-third of the lamb for 30 seconds or until browned. Transfer to a plate. Repeat, in 2 more batches, with remaining lamb, reheating the wok between batches.
### Step 2
Add the remaining oil and heat over high heat. Stir-fry the onion and capsicum for 5 minutes or until the onion softens. Add the peanuts, garlic, chilli and ginger and stir-fry for 30 seconds or until peanuts are golden.
### Step 3
Combine stock, oyster sauce, hoisin sauce and cornflour in a small jug. Add the stock mixture and lamb to the wok. Bring to the boil. Cook, stirring, for 2 minutes or until the sauce thickens. Stir in the shallot. Serve with rice and extra crushed chilli and hoisin sauce.
