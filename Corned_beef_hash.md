#### 0:15 Prep -- 0:30 Cook -- 4 Servings
## INGREDIENTS
* 1 pound cooked corned beef
* 5 to 6 small (about 1 pound) potatoes (white, red, or Yukon gold)
* 1/4 large onion (about 1/2 cup after chopping)
* 1 clove garlic
* 1/4 teaspoon paprika
* salt and freshly ground black pepper
## METHOD
### Step 1
Cut the potatoes into quarters and transfer simmer them in a large pot of salted water for about 15 minutes. They should be slightly undercooked when you take them out. Let them cool.
### Step 2
In the meantime, chop up the corned beef (about 1/2-inch dice is perfect), onion, and garlic, and combine. 
### Step 3
Chop up the cooked potatoes about the same size as you chopped the corned beef, and combine them with the corned beef mixture.
### Step 4
Season the mixture with paprika, salt, and freshly ground black pepper to taste. (See note below.)
### Step 5
Press the corned beef hash onto a lightly oiled griddle or skillet and cook over medium-low heat for about 15 minutes or until the bottom is nicely browned.
### Step 6
Flip the hash with a long spatula and continue cooking until the bottom is nicely browned, about another 15 minutes.
### Step 7
Serve right away with your favorite eggs.
