## METHOD
### Step 1
Preheat oven to 180C/160C fan forced. Line a large baking tray with non-stick baking paper. Cook potatoes in a large saucepan of boiling water for 10-15 minutes or until just tender but still holding shape.
### Step 2
Spread kale and capers over oven tray and spray with oil. Add garlic and toss, rubbing in with your fingertips. Season. Bake for 10-12 minutes or until bright green and crisp.
### Step 3
Whisk yoghurt, mustard and vinegar in a small bowl. Season. Thin with water if needed.
### Step 4
Drain warm potatoes and transfer to a large bowl. Pour over dressing and toss to combine. Divide potatoes between serving bowls. Top with celery, sauerkraut and onion. Scatter over crispy kale and capers. Serve with toasted walnuts and pomegranate arils if desired.
