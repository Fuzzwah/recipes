#### 0:15 Prep -- 0:40 Cook -- 4 Servings
## INGREDIENTS
* 2 cups finely grated parmesan cheese
* 1 litre salt reduced chicken style liquid stock
* 1 tablespoon olive oil
* 1 large red onion, finely chopped
* 2 garlic cloves, crushed
* 1 1/2 cups arborio rice
* 1/2 cup dry white wine
* 1 1/3 cups (200g) frozen corn & peas
* 2 tablespoons chopped fresh oregano
## METHOD
### Step 1
Preheat oven to 200°C/180°C fan-forced. Line a large baking tray with baking paper. Sprinkle three-quarters of the cheese in a thin layer on prepared tray. Bake for 2 minutes or until cheese is melted and golden. Cool on tray. Break into pieces to make wafers. Set aside.
### Step 2
Bring stock and 1 cup cold water to the boil in a saucepan over high heat. Reduce heat to low. Simmer, covered, until needed.
### Step 3
Meanwhile, heat oil in a large, heavy-based saucepan over medium heat. Add onion. Cook, stirring, for 5 minutes or until softened. Add garlic and rice. Cook, stirring, for 1 minute.
### Step 4
Add wine. Cook, stirring, until wine has absorbed. Add 1/3 cup stock mixture to rice mixture. Cook, stirring, until stock has absorbed. Repeat with remaining stock, 1/3 cup at a time, until all liquid has absorbed and rice is tender and creamy, adding frozen vegetables to rice mixture with final 1/3 cup stock. Remove from heat. Season with pepper. Stir in oregano and remaining cheese. Serve with cheese wafers.
