#### 0:15 Prep -- 0:20 Cook -- 4 Servings
## INGREDIENTS
* 2 cups (240g) frozen Corn Kernels
* 2 extra-large Eggs
* 2/3 cup (100g) White Self Raising Flour
* 1/4 cup (60ml) Full Cream Milk
* 1 zucchini, trimmed, coarsely grated
* 425g can Tuna Chunks in Springwater, drained, coarsely flaked
* 1/3 cup (80ml) Coles Sweet Chilli Sauce
## METHOD
### Step 1
Cook the corn in a saucepan of boiling water until heated through. Refresh under cold water. Drain well.
### Step 2
Whisk the eggs in a large bowl. Add flour and milk and stir until a smooth batter forms. Stir in corn and zucchini. Season. Gently fold through the tuna.
### Step 3
Heat a large non-stick frying pan over medium heat. Pour four 1/4-cup (60ml) portions of mixture around the pan, allowing room for spreading. Cook for 2-3 mins or until golden underneath. Turn and cook for 2 mins or until cooked. Transfer to a plate. Repeat, in batches, with remaining tuna mixture.
### Step 4
Divide fritters among serving plates. Serve with sweet chilli sauce and salad.
