1 onion, chopped
1 carrot, sliced
1 cup (250ml) light soy sauce
1 firmly packed cup (250g) brown sugar

METHOD
Step 1
Preheat the oven to 160Â°C.
Step 2
Heat oil in a flameproof casserole over medium-high heat. Season the beef, then in batches, cook for 3-4 minutes until browned all over. Remove from pan.
Step 3
Add the onion and carrot, then cook, stirring, for 2-3 minutes until browned. Add the soy, sugar, star anise, garlic, vinegar, stock, sesame oil and two-thirds of the spring onion and bring to a simmer. Add beef, then cover and transfer to the oven. Roast for 2 1/2-3 hours until meat is tender and falling off the bone.

Serve beef with rice, Chinese broccoli, chilli and remaining spring onion.
NOTES
Beef short ribs (from selected supermarkets and butchers) are ideal for slow cooking. You could also use 1kg beef blade steak, cut into 6cm chunks.
