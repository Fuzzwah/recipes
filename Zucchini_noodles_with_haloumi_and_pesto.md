#### 0:10 Prep -- 0:10 Cook -- 4 Servings
## INGREDIENTS
* 200g haloumi, cut into 2cm pieces
* 500g mixed tomatoes, halved
* 3 large zucchini, cut into long matchsticks
* 2/3 cup (180g) basil pesto
* 60g pkt Coles Australian Baby Rocket
## METHOD
### Step 1
Heat a large frying pan over medium-high heat. Spray with olive oil spray. Add the haloumi to the pan and cook, turning occasionally, for 2 mins or until the haloumi is golden brown. Transfer to a plate and cover to keep warm.
### Step 2
Add the tomato to the pan and cook, tossing, for 2 mins or until the tomato is just tender.
### Step 3
Return half the haloumi to the pan with the zucchini and half the pesto. Cook, tossing, for 2-3 mins or until heated through. Remove from heat. Add the rocket to the pan. Season. Toss to combine.
### Step 4
Divide the zucchini mixture evenly among serving plates and top with the remaining haloumi. Drizzle with remaining pesto and serve immediately.
