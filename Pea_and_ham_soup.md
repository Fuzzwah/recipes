#### 0:15 Prep -- 2:40 Cook -- 4 Servings
## INGREDIENTS
* 290g (1 1/3 cups) green split peas
* 2 tablespoons olive oil
* 2 carrots, peeled, chopped
* 2 sticks celery, trimmed, chopped
* 1 brown onion, halved, chopped
* 3 garlic cloves, crushed
* 700g ham or bacon hocks
* 1.5L (6 cups) cold water
* Salt & freshly ground black pepper
* Bread, to serve
## METHOD
### Step 1
Rinse split peas under cold running water until water runs clear. Drain.
### Step 2
Heat oil in a saucepan over medium heat. Add carrot, celery, onion and garlic, and cook, stirring, for 5 minutes or until the onion softens.
### Step 3
Add split peas, ham hocks and water. Bring to the boil over high heat. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer, covered, for 2 - 2 1/2 hours or until ham hocks are tender and the meat is falling away from the bones. Set aside for 5 minutes to cool slightly. Remove ham hocks from pan. Remove the meat from bones. Coarsely chop meat and set aside.
### Step 4
Place one-quarter of the pea mixture in the bowl of a food processor and process until smooth. Return to pan with ham. Repeat with remaining pea mixture. Taste and season with salt and pepper. Stir over medium-high heat for 5 minutes or until hot.
### Step 5
Ladle soup into bowls and serve immediately with crusty bread.
