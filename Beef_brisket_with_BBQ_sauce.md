#### 0:15 Prep -- 10:00 Cook -- 8 Servings
## INGREDIENTS
* 1.5 – 2 kg beef brisket
* 1 tbsp olive oil
## RUB
* 1 tbsp brown sugar
* 2 tsp paprika powder
* 1 tsp onion powder
* 1 tsp garlic powder
* 1/2 tsp cumin powder
* 3/4 tsp mustard powder
* 1 tsp salt
* 1/2 tsp black pepper
## BBQ SAUCE:
* 2 garlic cloves, minced
* 1/2 cup apple cider vinegar
* 1 1/2 cups ketchup
* 1/2 cup brown sugar, packed
* 2 tsp black pepper
* 2 tsp onion powder
* 2 tsp mustard powder
* 1 tsp cayenne pepper
* 1 tbsp Worcestershire sauce
## METHOD
### Step 1
Mix Rub ingredients. Rub all over brisket. 12 to 24 hours in the fridge.
### Step 2
Combine BBQ Sauce ingredients in a slow cooker. Mix then add the brisket – squish it in if needed.
### Step 3
Cook in slow cooker for 8 hours (1.5 kg) to 10 hours (2 kg) on low.
### Step 4
Remove brisket onto a tray. Fire up the BBQ.
### Step 5
Pour liquid in slow cooker into a saucepan. Bring to simmer over medium high heat and reduce until it thickens to a syrup consistency (it thickens more as it cools).
### Step 6
Oil the BBQ grill, place beef on the grills and leave until browned, then turn the beef over and brown the other side. Baste the beef generously and turn, then baste again. Do this repeatedly until there is a nice caramelised glaze on the brisket, then remove.
### TO SERVE
Slice brisket thinly across the grain and serve with remaining BBQ Sauce. This is terrific served as a meal with sides or piled high onto rolls with Coleslaw as sliders. See Note 3 for more ideas.
