#### 0:15 Prep -- 0:10 Cook -- 4 Servings
## INGREDIENTS
* 2 lemons
* 1 1/2 cups (110g) panko breadcrumbs
* 1/2 cup (150g) whole-egg mayonnaise
* 2 Chicken Breast Fillets, halved horizontally
* 1 tablespoon drained baby capers
* Mixed salad leaves, to serve
## METHOD
### Step 1
Finely grate half the rind of 1 lemon. Zest other half of the lemon. Combine the lemon rind and breadcrumbs in a large bowl. Cut the remaining lemon into wedges.
### Step 2
Spread mayonnaise over both sides of chicken, then dip in breadcrumb mixture, pressing to coat. Place on a baking tray.
### Step 3
Heat a greased large frying pan over medium-high heat. Cook chicken for 3-4 mins each side or until golden and cooked through. Transfer to a plate lined with paper towel.
### Step 4
Divide the chicken among serving plates and sprinkle with lemon zest and capers. Season. Serve with salad leaves and lemon wedges
## NOTES
Magic with mayo: Whole-egg mayonnaise is a mess-free way to crumb chicken â€“ it helps the crumbs stick without having to dip in egg. Try this, too: for perfect toasties, spread the outside of the bread with mayo instead of butter before toasting in a sandwich press or frying pan.
