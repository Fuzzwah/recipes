#### 0:30 Prep -- 0:55 Cook -- 6 Servings
## INGREDIENTS
* 3 russet potatoes
* 6 strips bacon
* 1 cup  shredded cheddar cheese
* 6 eggs
* 2 tablespoons fresh chives, chopped
## METHOD
### Step 1
Preheat oven to 200ËšC.
### Step 2
On a cutting board, peel potatoes then cut each in half widthwise.
### Step 3
Using a melon ball scooper or a metal teaspoon hollow out the potato starting from the cut side, once you have most of the potato hollowed out from that side create a smaller hole on the rounded side and continue hollowing until you can see through the potato.
### Step 4
Place potatoes in water to avoid discoloration while you finish hollowing out the rest.
### Step 5
Place potatoes with the smaller hole facing up on a parchment paper-lined baking sheet.
### Step 6
Wrap one piece of bacon and each potato, tucking in the end of the bacon so it stays in place. You might need to use a toothpick to hold the bacon in place.
### Step 7
Bake for 45 minutes, or until bacon reaches desired crispiness.
### Step 8
Allow potatoes to cool slightly then press cheddar cheese into the bottom of the potato.
### Step 9
Crack an egg over the top hole of the potato being careful not to let too much of the egg white pour over the side.
### Step 10
Sprinkle chives over the egg.
### Step 11
Bake for 6 to 12 minutes depending on how well done you would like your eggs.
### Step 12
Let cool before serving.
