#### 0:10 Prep -- 0:20 Cook -- 6 Servings
## INGREDIENTS
* 850g cauliflower, trimmed, cut into florets
* 2 cups self-raising flour
* 1 garlic clove, crushed
* 1/4 cup flat-leaf parsley leaves, chopped
* 1 cup grated parmesan cheese
* 2 eggs, lightly beaten
* 1 tsp sweet smoked paprika
* olive oil, for shallow-frying
## METHOD
### Step 1
Bring a saucepan of salted water to the boil over high heat. Add cauliflower. Return to the boil and cook, uncovered, for 4 to 6 minutes or until tender. Drain. Transfer to a food processor and chop. Place in a bowl. Set aside to cool.
### Step 2
Sift flour over cooled cauliflower. Add garlic, paprika parsley and parmesan. Stir to combine. Add  eggs and stir until well combined. Slowly add 1/4 cup water, stirring until a thick batter forms.
### Step 3
Add enough oil to a large, non-stick frying pan to cover base. Heat over medium heat until oil is hot. Using 1/4 cup of mixture per fritter, spoon ritters, 5 at a time, into hot oil. Cook for 4 to 5 minutes each side or until golden and cooked through. Transfer to a wire rack. Place in oven to keep warm while cooking remaining fritters.
### Step 4
Serve fritters hot or cold with sauces.
