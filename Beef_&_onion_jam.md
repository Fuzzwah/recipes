## BEEF FILLING - MAKES A DOUBLE BATCH
* 40g (1/4 cup) plain flour
* 1.5kg beef chuck steak, excess fat trimmed, cut into 5cm pieces
* 2 tablespoons olive oil
* 400g can diced tomatoes
* 250ml (1 cup) Massel beef stock

* 3 dried bay leaves
* 3 fresh thyme sprigs
* 300g rindless bacon rashers, coarsely chopped
* 1 leek, cut into 1cm thick slices
## METHOD
### Step 1
To make the beef filling, preheat oven to 180C. Place flour on a plate. Season with pepper. Toss beef in flour to coat. Heat half the oil in a frying pan over medium-high heat. Cook the beef, in 4 batches, turning, for 2-3 minutes or until browned, reheating the pan between batches. Transfer to a 3.5L (10 cup) ovenproof dish with a lid. Add the tomato, stock, red wine, bay leaves and thyme to the dish. Cover and bake for 2 1/2 hours.
### Step 2
Meanwhile, heat the remaining oil in a large frying pan over medium heat. Add bacon and leek. Stir for 5 minutes or until leek softens slightly.
### Step 3
Add the leek mixture to the beef filling and stir to combine. Cover and bake for a further 30 minutes or until the beef is very tender.
### Step 4
Meanwhile, heat the oil in a large frying pan over medium heat. Add the onion and thyme. Stir for 20 minutes or until onion caramelises. Add the sugar and vinegar. Stir for 3 minutes or until mixture thickens and liquid evaporates.
### Step 5
Transfer beef to a chopping board. Use two forks to shred the beef. Return beef to the pan. Spoon half the beef filling into a 1.75L (7 cup) ovenproof dish or frying pan, reserving remaining beef filling for another use. Whisk the egg, milk, parmesan, parsley and garlic in a bowl. Season with pepper. Dip the bread into the egg mixture for 30 seconds or until soggy, reserving excess egg mixture. Place the bread on top of the beef mixture, overlapping slightly. Spoon the onion mixture in between slices of bread. Pour over the reserved egg mixture. Bake for 30 minutes or until bread is golden. Top with cocktail truss tomatoes.
### NOTES
This recipe makes an extra batch of beef filling. Place the leftovers in an airtight container and freeze for up to 3 months. Thaw in the fridge overnight and reheat in the microwave.

For an easy meal, serve up the the leftover beef filling with polenta or mashed potato and some steamed green vegies.
