#### 0:05 Prep -- 6:00 Cook -- 8 Servings
## INGREDIENTS
* 1.8kg-piece boneless pork shoulder
* 2 teaspoon Masterfoods Paprika Smoked
* 1 small red onion, finely chopped
* 185ml (3/4 cup) tomato sauce
* 2 tablespoons brown sugar
* 1 1/2 tablespoons hot chilli sauce
* 1 tablespoon apple cider vinegar
* 1 tsp dried chilli flakes
* Pork rind, optional, for crackling
## METHOD
### Step 1
Place the pork in the base of a slow cooker. Rub with the paprika and season. Sprinkle the onion around the pork.
### Step 2
Combine the tomato sauce, sugar, chilli sauce, vinegar and chilli flakes in a bowl. Pour around the pork. Cover and cook on Low for 8 hours, turning halfway, or until the meat is very tender. Transfer the pork to a large bowl. Use 2 forks to coarsely shred the meat. Add enough of the cooking sauce to lightly coat the pork.
### Step 3
Meanwhile, for the crackling, preheat oven to 220C/200C fan forced. Place pork rind on a tray and sprinkle generously with salt. Roast for 40 minutes or until the rind is crackled. Cut into pieces.
### Step 4
Serve the pork with the remaining sauce and crackling, if you like.
