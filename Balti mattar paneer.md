## INGREDIENTS
* 400g paneer, (see note) cut into 1cm cubes
* 2 1/2 tablespoons vegetable oil
* 95g (1/3 cup) Tamar Valley Greek Style Yoghurt
* 110g (1/3 cup) sweet mango chutney (see note)
* 140g (1/2 cup) tomato paste
* 1/2 teaspoon caster sugar
* 2 teaspoons garam masala
* 2 cloves garlic, crushed
* 1/2 teaspoon chilli powder (see note)
* 120g (1 cup) frozen peas
* 1 green chilli, seeded, finely chopped
* 80ml (1/3 cup) pouring cream
* Naan or other Indian flatbread, to serve
* Pappadums, to serve
## METHOD
### Step 1
Toss paneer with 1 1/2 tablespoons oil in a bowl. Heat a non-stick frying pan over medium heat. Cook paneer, in 2 batches, turning for 3 minutes or until lightly browned all over. Transfer to a plate. Reserve pan.
### Step 2
Process yoghurt, chutney, tomato paste, sugar, garam masala, garlic, chilli powder and 1 teaspoon salt in a food processor to a smooth paste.
### Step 3
Heat remaining 1 tablespoon oil in reserved pan over high heat. Add the yoghurt mixture, bring to the boil, then simmer for 3 minutes. Stir in 250ml (1 cup) water. Bring to a simmer, then cook for a further 2 minutes or until heated through. Add paneer and peas, and cook for 5 minutes or until peas are tender. Stir in green chilli and cream, and bring to a simmer. Serve curry with naan and pappadums.
## NOTES
Paneer is an Indian-style cow's milk cheese made in a similar way to ricotta, but pressed afterwards to firm. We used Lemnos Paneer and Maharajah's Choice Sweet Mango Chutney, both available from supermarkets.
